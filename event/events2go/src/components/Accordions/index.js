          Events2go is the brainchild of our team at Techsphere Solutions Pty Ltd, who envisaged that this is the age of technology and 
          we need a new way of working that creates a culture that encourages collaboration and cooperation of units or organisations
          and maximise the use of technology for achieving greater productivity in the fast paced society, with COVID-19 like lockdown 
          situations where virtual door-knocking has become compulsive and to determine the well-being of remotely working 
          employees that has become essential in performance management and productivity.
